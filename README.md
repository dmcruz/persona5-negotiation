August 10th: 
- Added a dark mode.
- Added icon labels to the text/icon toggle for both question pages.
- Used local storage to keep toggle state.

- Organize the filters to show all the questions for pools of Shadows.
- Show corresponding personality only when filtering by Persona.
- Organize Shadows by level instead.
